    The ArraySort program contains classes and methods to provide the user with
    ways to implement, test and evaluate sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, 
    Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort. 

    Running each of the sorting algorithms creates a randomly generated integer
    array which is then stored in a text file. The stored array is then sorted
    using the specified algorithm, during which the time is recorded in seconds.
    The sorted array and these results are then output into text files for analysis.
